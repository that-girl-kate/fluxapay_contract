## 🛠 Deployment Process

### Automated Deployment via GitHub Actions

FluxaPay uses a multi-stage deployment pipeline with mandatory approval gates for production:

1. **Development** (Automatic on main push)
   - Deploys to testnet automatically
   - No approval required
   - Retention: 30 days

2. **Staging** (Automatic after dev success)
   - Deploys to testnet after dev succeeds
   - Requires successful dev deployment
   - Retention: 90 days

3. **Production** (Manual trigger only)
   - Deploys to mainnet
   - Requires manual workflow dispatch
   - Requires 2 team member approvals (GitHub Environment Protection)
   - Must pass staging first
   - Retention: 365 days

### Triggering Production Deployment

1. Navigate to the repository's Actions tab
2. Select "CD" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose "production" from the target-environment dropdown
5. Click "Run workflow"
6. **Required**: Two team members must approve in GitHub UI before deployment proceeds

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Verification

**After deployment completes, perform these verification steps:**

### Immediate Verification (Automated)
The CD pipeline automatically:
- Verifies contract is accessible on mainnet
- Logs contract address for verification
- Runs smoke tests

### Manual Verification Steps

1. **Verify Contract Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Check contract exists and is accessible
   stellar contract info interface \
     --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
     --network mainnet
   ```

2. **Verify Admin Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Confirm admin address is correct
   stellar contract invoke \
     --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
     --network mainnet \
     -- get_admin
   ```
   Expected: Returns the expected admin address

3. **Verify Merchant Registry**
   ```bash
   # Check a known merchant
   stellar contract invoke \
     --id <MERCHANT_REGISTRY_ID> \
     --network mainnet \
     -- get_merchant --merchant_id <KNOWN_MERCHANT_ADDRESS>
   ```

4. **Health Check**
   ```bash
   # Verify contract responds correctly
   stellar contract info interface \
     --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
     --network mainnet
   ```

5. **Monitor Initial Transactions**
   - Watch first few transactions on Stellar Expert explorer
   - Verify event logs are correct
   - Check for any error patterns

### Rollback Criteria
Roll back immediately if:
- Contract fails to respond
- Admin configuration incorrect
- Critical functionality broken
- Security vulnerability discovered

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### Pausing Operations

If a critical vulnerability or issue is discovered:

1. **Immediate Action**
   - Notify all team members via emergency channel
   - Document the issue and timestamp
   - Halt any pending deployments

2. **Contract-Level Response**
   - If admin controls exist, consider pausing critical functions
   - Monitor ongoing transactions
   - Prepare communication for users if needed

3. **Recovery Steps**
   - Assess severity and scope
   - Develop fix or mitigation
   - Follow expedited review process
   - Deploy fix with enhanced verification

## 📦 WASM Size Management

The CI pipeline enforces a `MAX_WASM_SIZE_KB=100` limit on the compiled WASM artifact.

### Optimization Process

All contracts are optimized using `stellar contract optimize` which applies `wasm-opt -O3` and other optimizations:

```bash
cd fluxapay && make optimize
```

### Current Sizes

| Contract | Optimized Size | Limit | Status |
|----------|---------------|-------|--------|
| PaymentProcessor | _Run `make optimize` to check_ | 100 KB | ✅ |
| RefundManager | _Run `make optimize` to check_ | 100 KB | ✅ |

> **Note**: Sizes may vary between builds. Run `make optimize` to verify current sizes.

### Size Reduction Strategies

If the WASM size approaches the limit, see [docs/WASM_OPTIMIZATION.md](docs/WASM_OPTIMIZATION.md) for detailed strategies including:
1. Removing dead code via `#[cfg(feature = "...")]` feature flags
2. Optimizing dependencies
3. Splitting into multiple contracts
4. Code-level optimizations

## 🌐 Network Configuration

All five FluxaPay contracts implement a custom `upgrade` function that performs state-aware upgrades (version tracking, event emission). Upgrading a contract requires admin authorization.

### Upgradeable Contracts

| Contract | Upgrade Function | Auth Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| `PaymentProcessor` | `propose_upgrade` / `execute_upgrade` / `cancel_upgrade` (Issue #846); legacy `upgrade_contract` timelock queue | AccessControl admin role |
| `RefundManager` | Same propose/execute/cancel path as PaymentProcessor | AccessControl admin role |
| `FXOracle` | `upgrade(admin, new_wasm_hash)` | AccessControl admin role |
| `MerchantRegistry` | `upgrade(admin, new_wasm_hash)` | `MerchantDataKey::Admin` check |
| `PaymentLinkManager` | `upgrade(admin, new_wasm_hash)` | Internal admin via `initialize` |

### Step 1: Upload New WASM

First, install the new WASM code on the network without deploying it to an instance.

```bash
stellar contract install --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/fluxapay.wasm --network testnet --source <ADMIN_SECRET>
```

Take note of the returned `Wasm Hash`.

### Step 2: Propose a time-locked upgrade (Issue #846)

Preferred path for `PaymentProcessor` / `RefundManager`:

```bash
# Propose — stores hash + earliest_execute = ledger + UPGRADE_TIMELOCK_LEDGERS
stellar contract invoke --id <PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_ID> --network testnet --source <ADMIN_SECRET> \
  -- propose_upgrade --admin <ADMIN> --new_wasm_hash <WASM_HASH>

# Optional: abort before the timelock elapses
stellar contract invoke --id <PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_ID> --network testnet --source <ADMIN_SECRET> \
  -- cancel_upgrade --admin <ADMIN>
```

`propose_upgrade` emits `UPGRADE/PROPOSED` with `(new_wasm_hash, earliest_execute)`.

### Step 3: Execute after the timelock

`execute_upgrade` reverts with `TimelockNotExpired` if called before
`earliest_execute`. On success it applies the **stored** WASM hash (hash
verification), clears the proposal, bumps the contract version, and emits
`UPGRADE/EXECUTED`.

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id <PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_ID> --network testnet --source <ADMIN_SECRET> \
  -- execute_upgrade --admin <ADMIN>
```

### Legacy / other contracts

```bash
# Legacy PaymentProcessor / RefundManager queue (Issue #624 timelock action)
stellar contract invoke --id <PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_ID> --network testnet --source <ADMIN_SECRET> -- upgrade_contract --admin <ADMIN> --new_wasm_hash <WASM_HASH>

# FXOracle
stellar contract invoke --id <FX_ORACLE_ID> --network testnet --source <ADMIN_SECRET> -- upgrade --admin <ADMIN> --new_wasm_hash <WASM_HASH>

# MerchantRegistry
stellar contract invoke --id <MERCHANT_REGISTRY_ID> --network testnet --source <ADMIN_SECRET> -- upgrade --admin <ADMIN> --new_wasm_hash <WASM_HASH>

# PaymentLinkManager (requires prior initialize call)
stellar contract invoke --id <PAYMENT_LINK_ID> --network testnet --source <ADMIN_SECRET> -- upgrade --admin <ADMIN> --new_wasm_hash <WASM_HASH>
```

### Notes
- **PaymentLinkManager** must be initialized via `initialize(admin)` before the first `upgrade` call. Without initialization, the admin storage key does not exist and non-admin callers will be rejected.
- Issue #846 upgrades emit `UPGRADE/PROPOSED` and `UPGRADE/EXECUTED`; legacy upgrade paths still emit `CONTRACT/UPGRADED` with `(old_version, new_version)`.
- The contract version is auto-incremented from `1.0.0` using semver patch bumps internally.
- Default `UPGRADE_TIMELOCK_LEDGERS` is 34_560 (~48 hours at ~5s/ledger).

## 🔑 Admin Key Rotation

Administrative roles for `PaymentProcessor` and `RefundManager` are managed via the `AccessControl` module.

### Rotating the Admin Role

To transfer administrative control to a new address:

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id <CONTRACT_ID> --network testnet --source <CURRENT_ADMIN_SECRET> \
  -- transfer_admin --current_admin <CURRENT_ADMIN_ADDRESS> --new_admin <NEW_ADMIN_ADDRESS>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Ensure the new admin address is correct and accessible before performing this operation. Administrative control can only be transferred, not recovered without the current admin's signature.

## ✅ On-Chain Verification

To verify the current state and administrative configuration of a deployed contract:

### Verify Admin

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id <CONTRACT_ID> --network testnet -- get_admin
```

### Verify Registry Info

```bash
# Verify a merchant in the registry
stellar contract invoke --id <MERCHANT_REGISTRY_ID> --network testnet -- get_merchant --merchant_id <MERCHANT_ADDRESS>
```

### Health Check (Simulation)

```bash
# Check if the contract is responsive
stellar contract info interface --id <CONTRACT_ID> --network testnet
```

# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Issue #831**: Multi-payee payment streams — `create_multi_stream` / `withdraw_multi_stream` / `get_multi_stream` with up to 10 weighted payees (`share_bps` must sum to 10_000). Docs in `docs/payment-streams-guide.md`.
- **Issue #832**: Hardened `changelog-check.yml` — fails without `CHANGELOG.md` updates unless labelled `skip-changelog`; Unreleased entries must reference the PR number. Documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Issue #833**: `open_dispute` / `create_dispute` cross-calls `MerchantRegistry.increment_merchant_dispute_count`; `get_merchant_dispute_count` returns the live merchant field (lifetime total for KYC — does not decrement on merchant-favour resolution; active counts remain in RefundManager).
- **Issue #834**: `@fluxapay/sdk/node` subpath export for Node.js 18+ with Stellar SDK HTTP defaults; browser build unchanged.

### Changed
- **Payment link max_uses cap**: `create_payment_link` accepts optional `max_uses: Option<u32>`. `use_link` enforces the limit and returns `LinkMaxUsesReached`. `use_count` is incremented atomically. Admin or merchant can call `update_link_max_uses` to raise the cap. SDK `createPaymentLink` exposes `maxUses` option.
- **Invoice payment link verification**: `create_invoice` cross-calls `PaymentLinkManager.get_link(payment_link_id)` when `payment_link_id` is provided, returning `InvalidPaymentLink` if the link does not exist or belongs to a different merchant.
- **CI Security Checks**: Added `cargo-deny` and `cargo-audit` jobs to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running on every PR targeting `main` and documented branch protection requirements in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Updated `README.md` to remove the "Local only" caveat.
- **Issue #853**: `DataKey::Payment` switched from holding a `String` to fixed-size `BytesN<32>` (SHA-256 hash of payment ID) via `payment_id_to_key(env, payment_id)`. Reduces Soroban storage rent and CPU costs significantly for high-volume merchants during create, read, and update operations.
  - **Migration Note**: This is an on-chain storage format change. Existing payments stored under the variable-length string key on previous testnet deployments are incompatible and will not be found under the hashed key; contract re-deployment or state migration is required.

### Fixed
- **CI**: Added missing `contract-dex-router` feature to `fluxapay/Cargo.toml` — resolves `unexpected_cfg` Clippy error for the `#[cfg(feature = "contract-dex-router")]` attribute in `dex_router.rs`.
- **CI**: Removed unused `String` import from `access_control.rs` and unused `Vec` import from `events.rs` — resolves `unused_imports` Clippy errors promoted to errors by `-D warnings`.
- **CI**: Fixed empty line between doc comment and `fn expiry_bucket_for` in `lib.rs:6933` — resolves `clippy::empty_line_after_outer_attr` error.
- **CI**: Added `#![allow(deprecated)]` and `#![allow(dead_code)]` to `access_control.rs`; per-function `#[allow(deprecated)]` on `register_session_key`, `revoke_session_key`, `execute_with_session` in `account_abstraction.rs`; `execute_swap` and `refund_caller` in `dex_router.rs`; and the four legacy-emit functions in `events.rs` — suppresses `env.events().publish` deprecation warnings pending migration to `#[contractevent]`.
- **CI**: Applied `cargo clippy --fix` automatic corrections across `lib.rs`, `payment_link.rs`, `fx_oracle.rs`, `utils.rs`, and other files: needless borrows, redundant `u32` casts, `map_or`/`len == 0` simplifications, and `!RangeInclusive::contains` rewrites.
- **CI**: Refactored manual loop patterns in `lib.rs` — `for i in 0..read_len` → iterator `.take()`, `loop { if let Some }` → `while let`, explicit counter loop → `.enumerate()`, manual slice copy → `copy_from_slice`, manual index loop → `.iter().take()`.
- **CI**: Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` to the duplicate `get_refund_internal`, `get_payment_refunds_internal`, and `get_refund_cooldown_secs` private helpers in the `PaymentProcessor` impl block that shadow the canonical `RefundManager` versions.
- **CI**: Added `#[allow(clippy::type_complexity)]` to `settle_payment` for the local `anchor_info` tuple type, and `#[allow(clippy::nonminimal_bool)]` applied via `cargo clippy --fix` to the refund authorisation guard.

### Added
- **Issue #625**: `Error::InputTooLong = 67` — new error variant returned when user-supplied string fields exceed their maximum allowed lengths: `reason` in refund creation (≤ 256 chars), `evidence` in dispute creation (≤ 512 chars), `resolution_notes` in dispute rejection (≤ 512 chars). Constants `MAX_REASON_LEN`, `MAX_EVIDENCE_LEN`, and `MAX_NOTES_LEN` defined in `lib.rs`. Error code documented in `docs/error-codes.md`.
- **Issue #619**: New CI job `indexer-build` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — installs dependencies, runs `npm run build`, and runs `npx tsc --noEmit` in `indexer/` to catch TypeScript errors before deployment. Added to the `ci-success` gate.
- **Issue #620**: New CI job `sdk-react-check` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — installs dependencies and runs `npx tsc --noEmit` in `sdk/react/` to catch TypeScript errors in React hooks before publish. Runs in parallel with `sdk-check`. Added to the `ci-success` gate.

### Fixed
- **Issue #626**: `reject_dispute` now decrements `MerchantDisputeCount` for the affected merchant when a dispute is rejected, so `get_merchant_dispute_count` reflects only active (non-rejected) disputes. The auto-suspension threshold no longer counts rejected disputes, preventing unjust merchant suspension.

- **Issue #671**: Added `docs/sdk-migration-guide.md` covering breaking-change migration steps between major `@fluxapay/sdk` versions, linked from `sdk/README.md` and `sdk/CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Issue #670**: `PaymentProcessor::get_creation_pause_info() -> PauseState` — read-only getter for the creation-only pause state, distinct from `get_pause_info()`'s consolidated global+creation view; clarified `set_creation_pause`/`set_global_pause` scope docs (creation pause never blocks `verify_payment`, `settle_payment`, `cancel_payment`, or refund/dispute flows).
- **Issue #668**: `PaymentCharge.payment_link_id: Option<String>` — populated by `use_link` with the source link's ID so payments can be traced back to the link that created them; `None` for payments created via `create_payment`/`swap_and_pay`. Updated the generated SDK `PaymentCharge` TypeScript type.
- **Issue #667**: `set_contract_metadata(admin, key: Symbol, value: String)` / `get_contract_metadata(key: Symbol) -> Option<String>` on `PaymentProcessor`, `RefundManager`, and `MerchantRegistry` — admin-gated on-chain metadata storage (instance storage, `LONG_LIVE_TTL`) for on-chain version/description tagging. `description`, `version`, and `deployed_at` are pre-populated on `initialize`.
- **Issue #378**: `cancel_refund` entry point — adds `RefundStatus::Cancelled`, transitions pending refunds to cancelled (requester or admin only), emits `REFUND/CANCELLED`, and excludes cancelled refunds from payment refund totals.
- **Issue #379**: Admin-configurable refund fee — `RefundFeeBps` stored in instance storage (default 100 bps at init); new `set_refund_fee_bps(admin, bps)` setter (0–1000 bps) and `get_refund_fee_bps()` getter; `process_refund` reads fee from storage.

### Fixed
- **Issue #374**: Removed unnecessary `mut` on `processed_count` and unused `now` in `process_due_subscriptions` batch processor (Clippy clean).
- **Issue #377**: `use_link` payment IDs now combine ledger timestamp with link `use_count` to prevent same-ledger collisions.

### Storage key layout changes (Issue #379)
- **Moved to instance storage**: `DataKey::RefundFeeBps` — initialized to 100 bps during `initialize_refund_manager`; previously read from persistent storage via multi-sig only.

### Added (prior) `settle_payment` correctly handles non-empty `splits` by distributing USDC according to `SettlementSplit.amount` and handles empty splits by transferring the full net amount directly to the merchant.
- **Issue #375**: `swap_and_pay` DEX integration — transfers input tokens to the router, enforces `amount_out_min` slippage and `expires_at` deadline, creates the payment after swap, and emits `SWAP/EXECUTED`.
- **Issue #376**: Subscription entry points on `RefundManager` — `create_plan`, `subscribe_to_plan`, `process_subscription`, `get_plan`, and merchant-aware `cancel_subscription`; subscription charge/cancel events documented in `EVENTS.md`.
- **Issue #373**: DexRouter stub cleanup — prefixed unused swap parameters and added TODO comments for real router integration.
- **Issue #372**: Removed unused test setup variables in `test.rs` to satisfy Clippy `-D warnings`.
- **Issue #390**: `settle_payment` correctly handles non-empty `splits` by distributing USDC according to `SettlementSplit.amount` and handles empty splits by transferring the full net amount directly to the merchant.
- **Issue #391**: Implemented `batch_expire_payments` for permissionless expiry sweeps up to 50 payments per call; fixed `expire_payment` to return `PaymentExpired` when attempting to expire a non-expired payment.
- **Issue #392**: Dispute Escalation logic: implemented `escalate_expired_disputes` to flag disputes past their `review_deadline` as escalated, processing up to 20 disputes permissionlessly.
- **Issue #393**: KYC Tier-Based Payment Limits: `MerchantRegistry` now supports `set_tier_limits` and `get_tier_limits`; `PaymentProcessor.create_payment` enforces `AmountBelowMin` and `AmountAboveMax` based on the merchant's tier limits.
- **Issue #394**: Multi-token support — added `set_usdc_token` function to configure a default settlement token and auto-whitelist it; `settle_payment` now supports per-payment token overrides via `payment.token_address`.
- **Issue #413**: Multi-currency invoicing for payment links — added `fiat: Option<FiatConfig>` to `create_link` with `FiatConfig { amount, currency, oracle }` and `MaybeFiatConfig` Soroban-compatible wrapper; `use_link` resolves the USDC equivalent via the FX oracle at exchange time.
- **Issue #395**: Contract upgrade mechanism — added `upgrade` function to `FXOracle`, `MerchantRegistry`, and `PaymentLinkManager` with admin authorization and `CONTRACT/UPGRADED` event emission; enhanced `RefundManager::upgrade_contract` with version tracking and event emission.
- **Issue #406**: Fixed rate-limit window bypass — changed `enforce_create_payment_rate_limit` and related functions from a sliding-window to a fixed-window strategy anchored to the first payment in the window, preventing burst-burst boundary bypass.
- **Issue #399** — Idempotency key TTL: `DataKey::IdempotencyKey` entries are now stored with a TTL derived from the payment expiry window (ledgers ≈ `(expires_at − now) / 5`, minimum `SHORT_LIVE_TTL`) instead of the permanent `LONG_LIVE_TTL`. A new reverse-map key `DataKey::PaymentIdempotencyToken(payment_id)` is also stored so `cancel_payment` and `expire_payment` can proactively remove the forward key, freeing the `client_token` for reuse immediately after a payment is cancelled or expired.
- **Issue #398** — `MerchantRegistry::transfer_admin(current_admin, new_admin)`: allows the current admin to hand off registry ownership atomically. Validates stored admin matches `current_admin`, updates `MerchantDataKey::Admin`, and emits `MERCHANT_REGISTRY/ADMIN_TRANSFERRED`. Added `get_admin()` getter. Old admin loses all privileges immediately after transfer.
- **Issue #397** — Stellar memo type validation in `create_payment`: `memo_type` must be one of `Text`, `Id`, `Hash`, or `Return`; Text memos are rejected if > 28 bytes; Id memos are rejected if not a valid `u64` decimal string. New error codes: `InvalidMemoType = 50`, `MemoTooLong = 51`, `InvalidMemoId = 52`. Validation is a no-op when `memo_type` is `None`.
- **Issue #396** — `get_merchant_payments_full(merchant_id, offset, limit) -> Vec<PaymentCharge>`: paginated getter returning full `PaymentCharge` structs (not just IDs) with `limit` silently capped at 50. Added `get_merchant_payment_count_for_dashboard(merchant_id) -> u32` for pagination UI total-count queries. Empty result (not error) when `offset` exceeds count.

### Storage key layout changes (Issue #399)
- **New key**: `DataKey::PaymentIdempotencyToken(String)` — reverse map from `payment_id` → `client_token`; stored and removed alongside `DataKey::IdempotencyKey`. Existing `IdempotencyKey` entries written by prior contract versions carry `LONG_LIVE_TTL` and will naturally expire; new entries use payment-scoped TTLs.
- `allow_token` unauthorized non-admin test for token allowlist enforcement (closes #328)
- `settle_payment` tests for unauthorized operators, pending/expired rejection, and `PAYMENT/SETTLED` event emission (closes #326)
- `get_merchant_payments_paginated` optional `status_filter` parameter to paginate merchant payments by `PaymentStatus` (closes #280)
- `scripts/deploy-testnet.sh`: builds all contract WASMs and deploys them to the configured Stellar network; writes resulting contract IDs to `.env.testnet`; fails fast if `STELLAR_SECRET_KEY` or `STELLAR_NETWORK` are unset (closes #294)
- `docs/local-invoke.md`: CLI recipe sections for `create_refund`, `process_refund`, `create_dispute`, `set_dispute_deadline`, `resolve_dispute_with_refund`, `verify_payment`, `settle_payment`, `set_paused`, `set_rate`, `create_link`, and `use_link` — each with full command, expected output, and error scenarios (closes #299)
- `docs/local-invoke.md`: Deployment section documenting how to run `scripts/deploy-testnet.sh` and load `.env.testnet`

- `check_dispute_deadline(dispute_id)`: public callable to trigger escalation when a dispute review deadline has elapsed; emits `DISPUTE/ESCALATED` and is a no-op if not passed/already escalated/resolved (closes #306)
- `top_up_stream(stream_id, amount)`: allows a sender to top up a single stream via direct token transfer; credits the stream deposit and emits `STREAM/TOPPED_UP` (closes #305)
- Treasury accounting: refund-time fees now accumulate in `DataKey::TreasuryBalance`; adds `get_treasury_balance()` and `withdraw_treasury(admin, amount, destination)` for admin withdrawals; emits `TREASURY/WITHDRAWN` and introduces `Error::InsufficientTreasuryBalance` (closes #291)
- `create_payments_batch`: atomic batch payment creation API with a maximum batch size of 50 and per-merchant batch rate-limit enforcement; returns payment IDs in order and emits `PAYMENT/CREATED` for each payment (closes #293)

- AccessControl edge-case tests: `renounce_role` idempotency for non-holders, self-role removal, and unauthorized `transfer_admin` validation (closes #337)
- FXOracle role management tests: `oracle_grant_role` by admin/non-admin authorization, `oracle_has_role` verification, and `get_fx_admin` initialized/uninitialized states (closes #335)
- MerchantRegistry pagination tests: `get_all_merchants` offset-based edge cases including beyond-range offsets and zero-limit handling (closes #337)
- PaymentStreaming batch operation tests: `top_up_multiple_streams` authorization and deposit updates, `cancel_multiple_streams` atomicity with invalid IDs, `batch_withdraw_to` multi-destination routing and zero-accrued stream handling (closes #336)
- PaymentLinkManager batch verification tests: `verify_batch` coverage for active/missing/deactivated links and empty input handling (closes #334)

### Changed
- **Issue #394**: `create_link` now accepts 10 parameters (fiat params bundled into `FiatConfig`); `PaymentLink` struct stores `fiat: MaybeFiatConfig`; existing `create_link` and `use_link` signatures updated accordingly.
- **All contracts**: Added `CONTRACT/UPGRADED` event emission pattern for upgradeability.

## Contract Versions

Each contract exposes a `version() -> u32` function. Bump this value whenever a storage key or struct layout changes in a breaking way.

| Contract            | Current Version |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| `PaymentProcessor`  | 1               |
| `RefundManager`     | 1               |
| `FXOracle`          | 1               |
| `PaymentLinkManager`| 1               |
| `MerchantRegistry`  | 1               |

## Upgrade Checklist

When deploying a new contract version:

1. **Read old state** — call `get_payment`, `get_refund`, etc. on the live contract and confirm structs deserialise correctly with the new code before upgrading.
2. **Bump `version()`** — increment the constant in the relevant `impl` block.
3. **Migrate if needed** — if a `#[contracttype]` struct gains or loses fields, write a one-shot migration entry-point that reads the old layout and rewrites under the new key/struct before the upgrade goes live.
4. **Update this file** — add a new `## v<N>` section documenting every changed key, struct field, or event signature.
5. **Test** — run `cargo test --all-features` and the bounded property tests locally before opening a PR.

# Unified Contract Error Code Reference

This document is the single source of truth for every `#[contracterror]` enum
across the Fluxapay contracts. Each error surfaces to callers as
`Error(Contract, #<code>)`; use the tables below to look up what a numeric
code means, what typically causes it, and how to fix it.

`sdk/src/index.ts` exports `FLUXAPAY_CONTRACT_ERROR_MAP`, which mirrors the
**Core (`PaymentProcessor` / `RefundManager`)** table below — the only
contract whose error map is safe to expose as a single flat `code -> name`
map in the SDK (see the note on code collisions at the end of this
document). `scripts/check-error-map-sync.ts` parses the Rust source and this
document on every CI run to catch drift between them.

## Core: `PaymentProcessor` / `RefundManager` (`fluxapay/src/lib.rs::Error`)

| Code | Name | Description | Common Cause | Remediation |
|------|------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | `Unauthorized` | Caller lacks the required role/permission. | Calling an admin/merchant/oracle-only function from an unauthorized address. | Grant the correct role via `access_control`, or call from an authorized address. |
| 2 | `PaymentAlreadyExists` | A payment with this `payment_id` was already created. | Reusing a `payment_id` (often a retry without a fresh ID). | Generate a new unique `payment_id`, or fetch the existing payment instead. |
| 3 | `PaymentExpired` | The payment's `expires_at` has passed. | Verifying/paying after the payment window closed. | Create a new payment; consider extending `duration_secs` for long-lived flows. |
| 4 | `InvalidPaymentId` | `payment_id` failed format validation (length/charset). | ID shorter than 3 or longer than 64 chars, or contains disallowed characters. | Use 3–64 chars of `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]` only. |
| 8 | `RefundAlreadyProcessed` | The refund is not in a state that can be processed again. | Calling approve/reject/process on a refund that's already `Completed` or `Rejected`. | Check `get_refund` status before acting; this is typically not retryable. |
| 9 | `DisputeNotFound` | No dispute exists with the given ID. | Typo'd dispute ID, or dispute was never created. | Verify the dispute ID via `get_dispute`/list endpoints. |
| 12 | `DisputeAlreadyResolved` | Dispute has already reached a final resolution. | Voting/resolving a dispute twice. | No action needed — the dispute outcome is final. |
| 14 | `PaymentAlreadyProcessed` | Payment is not `Confirmed`/`Overpaid`, so refund/settlement isn't allowed. | Refunding a `Pending`, `PartiallyPaid`, or already-refunded payment. | Wait for confirmation, or check `payment.status` first. |
| 15 | `AccessControlError` | An underlying access-control check failed (see `AccessControlError` table). | Role/admin operation failed in the shared access-control module. | Inspect the wrapped `AccessControlError` variant for specifics. |
| 16 | `RefundExceedsPayment` | Sum of non-rejected refunds would exceed the original payment amount. | Requesting a refund larger than the remaining refundable balance. | Request an amount ≤ `payment.amount - sum(non-rejected refunds)`. |
| 17 | `ContractPaused` | The contract is globally paused. | An admin invoked the emergency pause. | Wait for an admin to unpause, or contact the operator. |
| 18 | `RateLimitExceeded` | Caller exceeded a configured rate limit. | Too many requests/payments in a short window. | Back off and retry after the rate-limit window resets. |
| 19 | `RefundCancelled` | The refund was cancelled and cannot be processed. | Acting on a refund after it was explicitly cancelled. | Create a new refund request if still eligible. |
| 20 | `UnsupportedToken` | The token address is not an accepted asset. | Using a token not configured for this deployment. | Use one of the supported token addresses for this environment. |
| 21 | `AmountBelowMin` | Amount is below the configured minimum. | Payment/stake amount too small. | Increase the amount to at least the configured minimum. |
| 22 | `AmountAboveMax` | Amount exceeds the configured maximum. | Payment/stake amount too large. | Reduce the amount, or split into multiple payments. |
| 23 | `InvalidExpiry` | `expires_at` is invalid (e.g. in the past, or before `start_time`). | Passing a stale or malformed timestamp. | Pass a future Unix timestamp greater than "now". |
| 24 | `InvalidSettlement` | Settlement parameters/signatures failed validation. | Malformed or mismatched collaborative-settlement data. | Re-derive settlement data per `docs/` settlement guide and retry. |
| 25 | `DuplicateIdempotencyKey` | `client_token` was already used for a different payment. | Retrying a request with the same idempotency key but different params. | Reuse the key only for byte-identical retries, or mint a new key. |
| 26 | `InvalidAddress` | An address argument failed validation. | Passing a malformed or zero address. | Pass a valid Stellar/Soroban `Address`. |
| 27 | `ArbitrageDetected` | Swap path forms a circular/arbitrage route. | DEX router path validation rejected the route. | Use a direct, non-circular swap path. |
| 28 | `SwapPathInvalid` | DEX swap path or quoted return failed validation. | Malformed path, or quote inconsistent with path. | Re-quote the path via the DEX router before submitting. |
| 29 | `OraclePriceDeviation` | DEX quote deviates too far from the oracle reference price. | Stale quote, or thin liquidity causing slippage. | Re-quote closer to execution time, or reduce trade size. |
| 30 | `SubscriptionInGracePeriod` | Subscription payment failed but is within its retry grace period. | Informational — not a terminal failure. | No action required; the daemon will retry automatically. |
| 31 | `SubscriptionRetryExhausted` | Subscription exhausted all retries and is now cancelled. | Payment method kept failing through all retry attempts. | Re-subscribe with a valid, funded payment method. |
| 32 | `InvalidResumeTimestamp` | Resume timestamp is in the past or otherwise invalid. | Resuming a paused subscription/stream with a bad timestamp. | Pass a resume timestamp ≥ current ledger time. |
| 33 | `MerchantAuthError` | An underlying `MerchantAuthError` occurred (see that table). | Pre-authorization pull failed a sub-check. | Inspect the wrapped `MerchantAuthError` variant for specifics. |
| 34 | `InvalidSplitSum` | Dispute payout_splits amounts don't sum to the dispute amount. | Miscalculated split allocation in dispute resolution. | Ensure payout_splits sum equals the dispute amount. |
| 35 | `MissingReceiptHash` | Refund policy requires a `receipt_hash` but none was provided. | Creating a refund without a required receipt attachment. | Supply a valid receipt hash with the refund request. |
| 36 | `RefundExpired` | The refund's `expiry_at` deadline has passed. | Approving/rejecting a refund after `expiry_at`. | Requester must create a new refund request. |

| 51 | `UpgradeFailed` | Contract upgrade rejected the new WASM hash. | Invalid or incompatible upgrade payload. | Verify the WASM hash and upgrade authorization, then retry. |
| 52 | `InsufficientTreasuryBalance` | Treasury balance is smaller than the requested withdrawal amount. | Withdrawing more than the treasury holds. | Reduce the withdrawal amount, or wait for treasury deposits. |
| 53 | `MetadataTooLarge` | Metadata map has more than 20 keys. | Attaching too many metadata fields to a payment. | Reduce to ≤ 20 keys, or store extra data off-chain. |
| 54 | `MetadataValueTooLong` | A metadata value exceeds 256 characters. | Oversized value in the `metadata` map. | Shorten the value to ≤ 256 characters. |

| 65 | `RouteOutputInsufficient` | Aggregate route output is less than minimum output amount. | Swap output too low due to slippage or thin liquidity. | Re-quote with a lower minimum output, or reduce trade size. |
| 66 | `BatchContainsDuplicates` | Batch payment creation contains duplicate payment IDs. | Submitting a batch where two or more entries share the same `payment_id`. | Ensure all `payment_id` values in the batch are unique. |
| 67 | `InputTooLong` | A user-supplied string field exceeds its maximum allowed length. | `reason` > 256 chars in refund creation; `evidence` > 512 chars in dispute creation; `resolution_notes` > 512 chars in dispute rejection. | Shorten the field: `reason` ≤ 256 chars, `evidence` ≤ 512 chars, `resolution_notes` ≤ 512 chars. |
